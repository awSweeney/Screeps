## Screeps AI

WIP AI for the game screeps. By no means is this the most efficient way to do things currently. As with most things screeps, things were coded in haste to deal with rising situations.

## Automation Features

Extensions, initial road paths and spawning/creep scaling are all roughly automated.

## Flag Usage

### Creeps

**attack** to gather an offensive force.

**standby** to have an army rally to a location during peace.

**claim** to send an expeditionary force to claim a room.

### Structures

Place a **collecLink** on a link to set as collection point.

Place a **depositLink** on a link to set as deposit point.

Link flags will disapear once points are assigned.
